Audit Type: ${type.toUpperCase()}
Severity Level: ${severity}
Project: ${project.name} (${project.type})
Working Directory: ${project.directory}

AUDIT TEAM: ${finalAuditors.join(', ') || 'Auto-assigned based on expertise'}

AUDIT SCOPE:
${this.getAuditScope(type)}

AUDIT PROTOCOL:
1. PREPARATION PHASE:
   - Review project architecture and dependencies
   - Analyze specs for security and quality requirements
   - Set up audit tools and scanning environments
   - Create audit checklist based on type and severity

2. EXECUTION PHASE:
${this.getExecutionSteps(type, severity)}

3. ANALYSIS PHASE:
   - Categorize findings by severity and impact
   - Identify root causes and systemic issues
   - Cross-reference with industry best practices
   - Prioritize remediation efforts

4. REPORTING PHASE:
   - Document all findings with evidence
   - Provide specific remediation steps
   - Include code examples and fixes where applicable
   - Create implementation timeline for fixes

SEVERITY REQUIREMENTS:
${this.getSeverityRequirements(severity)}

DELIVERABLES:
- Comprehensive audit report with findings
- Prioritized remediation action plan
- Security/quality improvement recommendations
- Follow-up audit schedule and procedures
