RELEASE PROTOCOL:
1. PRE-RELEASE VALIDATION:
   - Verify all specs are complete and approved
   - Run full test suite and ensure 100% pass rate
   - Check code quality metrics meet release standards
   - Validate deployment scripts and configurations

2. RELEASE PREPARATION:
${this.getReleaseSteps(type, environment)}

3. QUALITY ASSURANCE:
   - Perform final integration testing
   - Security scan and vulnerability assessment
   - Performance benchmarking against baseline
   - User acceptance testing completion

4. DEPLOYMENT COORDINATION:
   - Coordinate team for deployment window
   - Prepare rollback procedures and contingencies
   - Set up monitoring and alerting for release
   - Brief team on post-deployment verification steps

5. POST-RELEASE ACTIVITIES:
   - Monitor system health and performance
   - Validate key functionality in ${environment}
   - Document any issues and resolutions
   - Prepare for ${environment === 'staging' ? 'production deployment' : 'next release cycle'}

RELEASE CHECKLIST:
${checklist ? this.generateReleaseChecklist(type, environment) : 'Checklist generation disabled'}

TEAM ASSIGNMENTS:
${this.getTeamAssignments(existingTeam.agents, type)}

RISK MITIGATION:
- Deployment rollback plan prepared and tested
- Database backup and recovery procedures verified
- Team communication channels established
- Emergency contact list updated

Execute coordinated release with comprehensive validation and team coordination.`;
